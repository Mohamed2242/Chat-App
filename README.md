I've successfully developed this application using a robust tech stack to ensure a seamless and real-time messaging experience:

🔹 Backend Technologies: 
         • .NET 8
         • Web API
         • SignalR

🔹 Frontend Technologies: 
         • React
         • Bootstrap

This project leverages SignalR for real-time communication, providing users with instant message delivery and a smooth chatting experience.

The backend, built with .NET and Web API, ensures reliable and efficient data handling, while the React and Bootstrap offers a user-friendly and responsive interface.

🔹 Features include:

• Real-time messaging with SignalR.
• Secure and efficient data management.
• Responsive design with React and Bootstrap.

This project not only enhanced my skills in full-stack development but also reinforced my passion for creating dynamic and user-centric web applications.
